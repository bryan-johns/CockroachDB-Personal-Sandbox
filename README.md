# CockroachDB Personal Sandbox

Recently I became interested in CockroachDB and what it could do for me. I created this repo as a place to play around with the database and see what I could do with it.

The initial docker setup I'm using can be found here: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster-in-docker.html
